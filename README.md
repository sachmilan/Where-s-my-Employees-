# Where's my Employees???

## Description

-  In today's busy era, nobody have time to go through files and search for the employees. So this gave me an idea to create an application which will create the employee database for you.

- To achieve my goal, I created this application. In this application you can type in the contents, and it will type those contents in the Employee database for you.

- It will make the hectic life of today's human a bit easy. Thus giving them a siegh of relief, as they do not have to worry about making massive files anymore.

- Java script was totally new to me, so I learned them and used them in a way which enhances my understanding of them.
